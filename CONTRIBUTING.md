# Contributing (Course)

## Branching
- Use feature branches: `team/<name>/<feature>`
- Open PRs for simulator core changes

## Code quality
- Prefer small functions with clear docstrings
- Add/adjust tests in `tests/` for simulator logic

## Data & secrets
- Do not commit API keys, tokens, or credential exports.
- Commit only small sample datasets if needed (<= a few MB).
